  <h2 class="section-title">Next Steps</h2>
  <p>Data visualization is hard, particularly the d3.js library. It takes time, patience, skill, and luck.</p>
  <p>If I had more time, skills, and patience with programming, there are some things I would want to add to this project.</p> 
  <p> First, I would add demographic data for each borough. My focus on the housing characteristics data 
is limited without more information on the people who live within the Census tracts. Second, I would add some 
data that might indicate vulnerabilities around clusters of inadequate plumbing. Namely, a layer of FDNY fire stations, 
a layer of density of 311 calls regarding heat and hot water complaints, and a layer of other water sources available 
(such as public bathrooms and pools). I might also add a layer of data regarding 311 calls for homeless persons "in need 
of assistance".</p>
