    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>This website asks you, the viewer, to explore an interactive
    map of New York City. It invites you to imagine maps such as
    this as tools of urban governmentality. By this term I mean
    administration, management, and a general approach to the
    operation of government as forms of population management (Rose
    et al, 2006). Information visualization is a practice central
    to administration of public data; visualizations render
    information into representations that can trigger action. It is
    thus important to consider how and in what ways visualizations
    render information about the world, making seem more knowable,
    thus creating impetus for action (or inaction). Put simply, 
    data visualizations are inherently political (Boenhert, 2016).</p>
    <p>To explore this perspective on data visualization, the map you
    will interact with in the next tab ("Map") depicts
    data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey
    2015-2020 Five Year Estimates, particularly data on plumbing
    facilities, using a very simple demonstration of the D3.JS library. 
    Under the Housing Characteristics section of the survey, it 
    reports whether a building has adequate or inadequate plumbing facilities. 
    This data is sorted into owner-occupied and renter-occupied, and the
    available data is organized at the level of Census tract.
    Tracts are the build block of Census geographic data, adopted
    in 1940 (US Census Bureau, n.d.).</p>
    <p>Indoor plumbing is an interesting question to look at because it is
    an aspect of "housing" that is often presumed or taken for
    granted. Though initially arriving in the United States in the 1840's 
    and considered a provenance of the rich and well-off, 
    since the 1940's indoor plubming has become increasingly standardized. 
    Housing is thus evaluated on these characteristics as to whether or not 
    it is sufficient and adequate. 
    The buildings marked in this data set are marked as occupied,
    yet many do not have adquate plumbing. An article <a href=
    "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/27/water-almost-half-million-us-households-lack-indoor-plumbing">
    published in The Guardian in 2021</a> described the phenomenon
    of "plumbing poverty" in the United States, where nearly half a
    million households lack adequate indoor plumbing, many of them in urban settings. 
    Here we will focus soley on New York City. Although plumbing poverty has decreased
    in New York City, it is still significant. It is also a point of intersection between the
    built environment, housing, government administration, and
    social services. Under NYC housing code, it is required that
    landlords provide functioning water systems and plumbing to
    tenants (NYC Department of Housing Preservation and
    Develompent, 2021). A lack of plumbing, in addition to
    violations of city code, can indicate a point at which
    "housing" is not adequate for modern standards, which could
    trigger administrative action such as building code
    inspections, child welfare investigations, or social service
    outreach, such as Adult Protective Services. It could also be a
    flashpoint of legal conflict between property owners and
    tenants.</p>
    <p>According to <a href=
    "https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/159767495/Plumbing_Poverty_in_US_Cities.pdf">
    a 2021 report by The Plumbing Poverty Project</a>, in New York
    City alone, 65,000 residents are estimated to not have access
    to piped water. </p>
    <p>As you explore the map, consider this, and what
    it might mean for people in New York. See the bar chart below
    for summary representation of this data in a bar chart. You can
    click on the buttons to toggle between owner-occupied and
    renter-occupied housing units.</p><br>
